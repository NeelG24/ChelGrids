Since the app is built in React Native, the installation process is straightforward. You'll need to have React Native, Node.js, Expo Go, and npm installed. 
Once you have these prerequisites, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal in the directory that contains the downloaded files of the app
2. Run npm install to install the necessary packages.
3. Run expo start or npm start in your terminal.
4. This will generate a QR code in your terminal window.
5. Use your iPhone's camera app to scan the QR code. By doing so, you'll be able to run the app on your phone. As you use the app,
you can observe data movement and events directly in the terminal.
